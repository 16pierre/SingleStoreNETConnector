# SingleStoreTransaction.Rollback method (2 of 2)

Rolls back the current transaction to the savepoint with the specified *savepointName* without aborting the transaction.

```csharp
public override void Rollback(string savepointName)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| savepointName | The savepoint name. |

## Remarks

The name must have been created with [`Save`](./Save.md), but not released by calling [`Release`](./Release.md).

The proposed ADO.NET API that this is based on is not finalized; this API may change in the future.
