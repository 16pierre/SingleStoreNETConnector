# SingleStoreTransaction.RollbackAsync method (2 of 2)

Asynchronously rolls back the current transaction to the savepoint with the specified *savepointName* without aborting the transaction.

```csharp
public override Task RollbackAsync(string savepointName, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |

The name must have been created with [`SaveAsync`](./SaveAsync.md), but not released by calling [`ReleaseAsync`](./ReleaseAsync.md).

The proposed ADO.NET API that this is based on is not finalized; this API may change in the future.
