## Remarks

This is an optional feature of the SingleStore protocol and may not be supported by all servers. It's known to be supported by SingleStore Server 5.7.3 (and later), MariaDB 10.2.4 (and later), SingleStore 7.5 and later. Calling this for SingleStore 7.5 and 7.6 resets the connection to no database selected. Other SingleStore-compatible servers or proxies may not support this command.
